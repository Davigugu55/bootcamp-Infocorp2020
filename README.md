# bootcamp-Infocorp2020

This is my first website, developed using CSS, HTML, javascript and Bootstrap.	This website was based on a figma prototype (https://www.figma.com/proto/W0D2uJm7KPp1Y0FJEX6njQ/),
as part of Infocorp's admission bootcamp. 

Infocorp is a junior enterprise from the computation institute of UFMT - Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso, located in Cuiab√°-MT, Brazil.	This is the first admission test after some basic training videos. Infocorp develops websites, mobile apps and web/desktop systems.
